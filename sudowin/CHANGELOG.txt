CHANGELOG

2006/07/05
----------
- Renamed the namespace PublicLibrary to Common

- Renamed Common.ManagedMethods to Common.Managed and source file accordingly

- Renamed Common.Win32 to Common.Native and source file accordingly 

2006/07/01
----------
- Created CachedCredentialsPlugin

- Created CachedCredentialsPlugin.LocalServer

2006/06/29
----------
- Added md5Checksum attribute to the command node.  This lets the administrator 
associate md5 checksums against configured executables to ensure the integrity 
of the file being sudoed.

- Gracefully handles errors in the callback application.

2006/06/25
----------
- Added allowAllCommands attribute to the default settings section in the 
XmlAuthorizationPlugin section.  This will create an insecure mode where all 
users can execute all commands.  This mode is not recommended and if used 
should only be used on stand-a-lone machines where users wish to practice LUA, 
but want easy sudo.


2006/06/24
----------
- Released Sudo for Windows version 0.1.0 (r95)

- Fixed bug that prevented Active Directory users from using sudo

2006/06/20
----------
- released Sudo for Windows version 0.1.0 (r76)

2006/06/17
----------
- changed the license copyright notice  to reflect the change from 
"sakutz@gmail.com" to "akutz@lostcreations.com" and from "Lost Creations" to 
"l o s t c r e a t i o n s"

- changed too much to count
