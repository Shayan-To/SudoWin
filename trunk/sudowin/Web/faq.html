					<p class="pSectionText">
						The console client binary is compiled as Sudowin.Clients.Console.exe, 
						but when Sudo for Windows is installed it renames the console client 
						to sudo.exe and adds the directory sudo.exe is in to the system's
						PATH environment variable.  This means that you can execute sudo.exe 
						from any directory in any command line interpreter.
