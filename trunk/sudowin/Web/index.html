				<p class="pSectionText">
					Sudo for Windows (sudowin) allows authorized users to launch 
					processes with elevated privileges using their own passphrase. 
					Unlike the runas command, Sudo for Windows preserves the 
					user's profile and ownership of created objects.

					The runas command
				</span>
				<p class="pSectionText">
					There seems to be a lot of confusion about what the Windows runas 
					command.  The runas command does not enable a user to escalate her 
					privileges, it allows the user to assume the identity of a privileged 
					account, if she knows the passphrase of that account.  For this reason 
					the runas command should be thought of as an equivalent to the UNIX/Linux 
					command, su.

					Desktop deployment
				</span>
				<p class="pSectionText">
					The Windows desktop environment would benefit greatly from Sudo for Windows.  
					Windows could ship from the factory with the Administrator account disabled 
					and the first user a member of the Sudoers group (much like Ubuntu Linux).  
					Whenever a user needed to make a system change she could simply escalate her 
					own privileges to do so instead of running the command with the Administrator 
					account.  Bringing the goodness of Linux to the world of Windows!

					Enterprise deployment
				</span>
				<p class="pSectionText">
					This is where Sudo for Windows really has an opportunity to shine.  Imagine that 
					you are an Active Directory administrator who delegates OU management to other 
					administrators.  Typically these administrators have two accounts -- one 
					unprivileged, everyday account, and one privileged account used for system 
					administration.  Keeping up with two accounts is a huge pain for administrators 
					and inevitably results in most of them staying logged into their computers as 
					the privileged account.
				</p>
				<p class="pSectionText">
					Instead, use Sudo for Windows.  Delegate permissions on OUs to groups that your 
					OU administrators are not normally members of.  Then when they use Sudo for Windows 
					to launch their MMCs, their privileges are escalated so that they have access to 
					manage their delegated OUs.  This is a very real example, and since Sudo for Windows 
					comes packaged as a MSI it can be rolled out to every machine you manage via that 
					wonderful thing we call Group Policy.
				</p>
				<p class="pSectionText">
					This is just one example, but imagine what you could do!  Every object in Active 
					Directory has permissions.  Now, all of a sudden, every object is more manageable 
					thanks to Sudo for Windows.  Sudo for Windows will create happier administrators 
					and a more secure environment.
